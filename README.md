# ChatBot Deployed Using Flask And JavaScript
This project shows how to build a chatbot using the PyTorch library in Python and training it with data collected from a website thanks to web scraping. 
Furthermore, the chatbot is deployed thanks to  Flask and JavaScript. 

## Main Libraries
- Nltk
- Torch
- Numpy

## Project summary
Before we start creating our chatbot, we need a json file containing all the data needed to train and test our AI.
After that, we need to install the necessary dependencies using `pip` :

```bash
pip install pytorch
pip install nltk
pip install flask
```

## Building a chatbot using Python
To build a chatbot with Python, you need to follow these steps :

1. Import and load the data file: Begin by importing and loading a data file containing predefined patterns and responses for the chatbot.

2. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the data to prepare it for training, which may include tasks such as tokenization and data cleaning.
 
3. Data splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the chatbot model effectively.

4. Build the artificial neural network (ANN) model using a framework like Keras. This model will be responsible for understanding and generating responses.

5. Prediction: Train the model to predict responses based on user input and the patterns in the data.

6. Deploy the model: Create a Flask web application to serve as the user interface for the chatbot, allowing users to interact with it via a web-based graphical user interface.

Each step contributes to the development and deployment of the chatbot, ensuring it can understand user queries and provide appropriate responses.
